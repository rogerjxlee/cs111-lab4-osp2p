# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We achieved parallelization by forking before each peer download and upload.
The child processes executed their specififed download/upload task and then
exited. The parent process continues forking for each download/upload task
that it encounters. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

Filenames longer than FILENAMESIZ-1 overrun the filename buffer. Fixed by
making sure that when we are copying the file name string, we do not copy 
more than FILENAMESIZ. Also we must null terminate the file name in case of
overflow to ensure proper handling of the string.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We made sure to account for numerous things such as:

checking if the filename was too long, including the space needed for GET
and OSP2P.

stopping a peer from downloading from an invalid director by detecting 
if there was a '/' in the filename.

accounting for large numbers of peers by increasing the buffer size 
by 10 times in order to avoid unexpectedly disconnecting from the tracker

making sure that no peer is downloading too much from the files to
avoid monopolizing other peer's resources

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
