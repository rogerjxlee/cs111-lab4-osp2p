# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We achieved parallelization by forking before each peer download and upload.
The child processes executed their specififed download/upload task and then
exited. The parent process continues forking for each download/upload task
that it encounters. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

Filenames longer than FILENAMESIZ-1 overrun the filename buffer. Fixed by
making sure that when we are copying the file name string, we do not copy 
more than FILENAMESIZ. Also we must null terminate the file name in case of
overflow to ensure proper handling of the string.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)




# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

Download: In evil mode, the program will send a GET request with a filename so
long that it will overflow the seeder's filename buffer. This should crash the
seeder with a segmentation fault. Since this code only sends a bunch of A
characters to the seeder, this buffer overflow will not be able to take control
of the seeder's computer. Since this attack would crash the seeder, it is an
attack on service. 

Upload: In evil mode, the program will continuously upload junk information to
the downloader. The peer will not be able to differentiate the junk information
from the file it is actually trying to download. Thus this will fill up the 
peer's memory with useless junk. This will not overwrite existing files, so
integrity is still intact, but the computer will become slower and be prevented
from downloading anything else.
